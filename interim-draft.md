# Releasing statistics in spreadsheets (interim version)

## Interim status 
This guidance is still under review. We are publishing it in an interim state to give people information on what they may need to implement and to collate feedback. We continue to carry out research and testing. When it is finalised it will be published on the Government Statistical Service webiste.  

If you have any questions or feedback, please email [gsshelp@statistics.gov.uk](mailto:gsshelp@statistics.gov.uk).  


## Accessibility, usability and machine readability 

### Accessibility 
Spreadsheets published online are covered by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1. The AA level of the WCAG 2.1 has to be met by law. 

Some of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 are generic in nature. Throughout this guidance, using our knowledge, research and interpretation of WCAG 2.1, we have tried to make a clear distinction between things we feel must be done in order to meet the legal accessibility regulations and things that are considered accessibility best practice.

### Usability 

Some of our advice is based on best practice for improving the usability of spreadsheets. This often overlaps with our advice for accessibility. We outline when a piece of advice relates to usability but is not covered by the legal accessibility regulations. 

### Machine readability 

Some sections mention best practice for machine readability. Often this overlaps with our advice for accessibility and usability. Sometimes it contradicts it. Depending on the complexity of your spreadsheets and your user needs you may need to publish two separate products, one for users who wish to download, read and analyse your spreadsheet and one for users who need your data to be optimsed for machine readability. 

We outline when the advice relates to machine readability and when there are possible clashes with the accessibility advice. 

We are planning to publish a checklist for making spreadsheets machine readable in the future if that is something you are specifically interested in.

## Document information 

Make sure you add document information in. The accessibility regulations require the title field and information about document language to be complete ([success criterion 2.4.2 page titled](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#page-titled) and [3.1.1 language of page](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/language-of-page)). It is best practice to also fill in the author and keyword fields, but optional with regards to accessibility regulations.

### Adding document information

Go to ‘File’, then ‘Info’ and fill in the following fields:
* Title

This should replicate the title on the cover sheet (more information on cover sheets can be found in the relevant section of this guidance). Do not use dashes or underscores here.

* Author

Generally this should be the organisation that published the document – avoid using names of individuals.

* Keywords or Tags

Put in a list of terms that someone might use to search for the document, separated by commas. This helps search engines find the document. They also help with finding your document internally.

### Setting the document language

Go to ‘File’ and then ‘Options’ and then ‘Language’. Make sure the document has the correct language(s) selected.

## Images

Avoid the use of any images or charts within a spreadsheet. This includes any departmental logos. 

If you can’t avoid it, make sure all logos, graphics, charts and any other images within the spreadsheet document have alternative text attached to them ([success criterion 1.1.1 non-text content](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#non-text-content)) and place them on a separate worksheet to any tables. You also need to ensure charts are accessible – see our ‘[Making analytical publications accessible](https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/making-analytical-publications-accessible/)’ guidance for more information. 

### How to add alt text for charts and images 
1. Right click on the image or chart and select 'Format Picture/Chart Area'.
2. Go to the size and properties box and select ‘Alt text’.
3. Enter a title and description for your alt text in the boxes and select ‘OK’.

On newer versions of Excel you may just need to right click and select 'Edit Alt Text'. 

If an image is just decorative you should mark it as such by ticking the 'Decorative' checkbox (Excel 2013 doesn’t let you do this but later versions do).

## Colour and formatting 

### Written content

All written content should follow the advice in the [‘Making written content accessible’ section](https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/making-analytical-publications-accessible/#section-4) of our ‘Making analytical publications accessible’ guidance.

### Hyperlink text

Embedding hyperlinks correctly is specifically mentioned in the accessibility guidelines. It comes under [success criterion 2.4.4 link purpose (in context)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#link-purpose-in-context) and [guideline 3.2 predictable](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#predictable).

#### Making hyperlinks accessible

1. Use specific descriptions 

Hyperlink text should be a specific description of the destination, not just ‘blog post’ or ‘report’ for example. The text should never be directional text like ‘click here’. Bear in mind that screen readers can be programmed to read out a list of links within a document. When link text is not specific, the links will be difficult to tell apart so the person cannot easily find a link they may be interested in.

2. Don't use URLs 

Do not use the [URL](https://techterms.com/definition/url) of a webpage as the hyperlink text, unless it is very short (e.g. www.unsplash.com). Long URLs get read out by a screen reader in full which can be very time consuming and annoying. Also, in most circumstances they do not describe the destination page.

3. Linking to documents 

If you are linking to another document the link text should contain the descriptive text, the type of document and its size, for example: ‘[Template to report breaches of the Code of Practice for Statistics (ODT, 23 KB)](https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Breach-reporting-template.odt)’.

4. Consistency in signposting  

Make sure that links to the same destination have consistent text and that links with different purposes and destinations have different link text. For example, it is bad practice to provide lots of links to different destinations with non-specific link text like ‘Find out more’.

5. Formatting link text

[Link text should be underlined by default](https://webaim.org/resources/linkcontrastchecker/?fcolor=0000FF&bcolor=FFFFFF). If it is not underlined the regulations say that you have to consider colour contrast with surrounding text and a 'visual cue' that appears on mouse hover and keyboard focus. Bear in mind that, while not a necessity in terms of the regulations, it is best practice for hyperlink text to be both underlined and have the correct amount of colour contrast with the background and the surrounding text.

### Dates and time periods 
It is best practice to format dates and time periods as advised by the [Office for National Statistics style guide](https://style.ons.gov.uk/house-style/dates/) and [Government Digital Service guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide/a-to-z-of-gov-uk-style). 

This means: 
* do not use dashes, use ‘to’, for example, don’t use ‘Jan – Mar 2020’ use ‘Jan to Mar 2020’
* it is fine to truncate days and months to save space
* do not truncate years – for example, write: ‘Jan 1931’ not ‘Jan 31’ 
* when referring to quarters of the year, write out the months, for example, “Jan to Mar 2020’ not ‘Q1 2020’
* if your data needs specific dates for example: 01/02/10 you can present them like this but be aware screen readers will read this as ‘01 slash 02 slash 10’ which can be annoying, so it is best practice to write ‘1 Feb 2010’

### Other accessibility pointers that must be followed: 

* No visual devices such as colour, shading or patterns should be used to divide up data regions ([success criterion 1.4.1 Use of colour](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#use-of-color) and [success criterion 1.3.3 sensory characteristics](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#sensory-characteristics).
* No text is set in a vertical or diagonal direction - this is not mentioned specifically in WCAG but we consider it necessary to pass [guideline 1. perceivable](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#perceivable) and [guideline 4. distinguishable](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#distinguishable).
* No text has spaces between letters in a word for visual effect as this can be difficult to read and screen readers will read the letters out one by one - this is not mentioned specifically in WCAG but we consider it necessary to pass [guideline 1. perceivable](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#perceivable)
* Colour is never used as the only way to communicate a message ([success criterion 1.4.1 Use of colour](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#use-of-color)).
* The minimum font size used is size 12 - in general this will help you meet [success criterion 1.4.4 resize text](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#resize-text).

### Accessibility pointers for best practice:

* All fonts used are sans serif (for example, Arial or Calibri) - people with dyslexia find serif fonts hard to read. 
* Avoid the use of underline and italic text - people with dyslexia can find italic and underlined text hard to read, if you need to highlight text it is best to use bold. 
* Avoid changing the colour of text to draw attention to it - if you do this you must check the colour contrast of the text against the background colour (more information on how to do this can be found in the 'checking text colour contrast' section). 
* Aim to use the 'default' or 'automatic' colour settings for all text - doing this will ensure the spreadsheet takes on the specialised colour settings users of assitive technology may have set up on their software.
* Avoid adding a background fill - some users will have settings that automatically change the colour of the background but this doesn't happen if you have added a fill colour – even if it is white. 
* Avoid adding grid lines or cell borders - in general it it better to keep things simple.
* Avoid including images of charts in your spreadsheet, if you do you must carefully consider their accessibility, particularly the colour contrast between chart elements.
* Left align all text in cells outside the table and all row headings within the table 
* Right align all data within a table and all column headings
* Use commas after every three decimal places in numbers of four digits or more, and never spaces (except when writing years - these should have no punctuation).

### Checking text colour contrast  

If colour is used in cells with text, use the [WebAIM colour contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to see if the colours meet the accessibility regulations. Remember, legally you need to meet the AA standard. 

Be aware that colours are coded in different ways. To use the WebAIM colour contrast checker you will need to know the hex code of the colours. Excel will give you the Red Green Blue (RGB) codes - you can use this [colour code converter](https://www.webfx.com/web-design/hex-to-rgb/) to get the hex codes.  

### Checking colour contrast in charts 

The use of colours in charts is more complex as you often have to consider colour contrast between different chart elements as well as with the background. Our [data visualisation guidance](https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/introduction-to-data-visualisation/#section-9) and the [style guide from the Office for National Statistics](https://style.ons.gov.uk/category/data-visualisation/using-colours/) both have useful tips on this area but neither have yet been fully updated with regards to the accessibility regulations. We are planning on looking into this in more detail soon. 


## Tables

### Merged and split cells
Restructure your tables so there are no split cells or merged cells. This can seem daunting, but it is one of the crucial issues to address as it is key for both machine readability and accessibility. 

Merged and split cells make tables hard to understand for users of assistive technology, removing them is key to meeting [success criterion 1.3.1 info and relationships](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#info-and-relationships). 

### Nested tables
Do not nest tables within other tables, this kind of structure is difficult to understand for users of assistive technology, removing them is key to meeting [success criterion 1.3.1 info and relationships](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#info-and-relationships).

### Macros, formulas and application code
We advise you to avoid publishing spreadsheets with macros in. It is difficult to ensure these meet the accessibility regulations and, in general, they are bad for machine readability. 

It is also best practice to remove formulas and any application code contained in your spreadsheet. Formulas and code can cause confusion and they can pose a security risk. If you have to include formulas or code, ensure they are hard coded to avoid accidental errors in use.

### Blank rows and columns
Remove all blank rows and blank columns. Blank rows and columns within the tables themselves may be perceived as the edge of the data area rather than a divider. Removing them is key to meeting [success criterion 1.3.1 info and relationships](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#info-and-relationships) and [success criterion 1.3.3 sensory characteristics](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#sensory-characteristics). If blank rows and columns are used to create space you can adjust column width and row height instead. 

### Mark up tables in spreadsheets
Ensure your table is ‘marked up’ as a table – this is key to meeting [success criterion 1.3.1 info and relationships](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#info-and-relationships), [guideline 2.4 navigable](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#navigable) and [success criterion 2.4.3 focus order](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#focus-order).

Marking up a table:
* allows a header row and table edges to be identified by assistive technology 
* allows your table to be named and appear in the 'go to' tool which is a keyboard shortcut that aids navigation (more information about this in the 'Naming tables' section)
* means a user will be able to tab through the data in a sensible way – for example when a user tabs to the end of the row, the next tab will take them to the start of the row below	
Note: if you keep tabbing past the end of the last row it does lead to extra rows being added to the table. However, as the table is marked up correctly, users of assistive technology should know when they get to the end of a table, so this isn’t considered an issue.

#### How to mark up a table in Excel: 
Be aware these instructions may differ slightly for different versions of Excel. At the moment this is a manual process, but we are researching ways to automate this. 

1. Select the cells you want to include in the table.
2. On the ‘Insert’ ribbon, select ‘Table’.
3. In the ‘Create table’ dialog box, check the ‘My table has headers’ box
4. Select ‘OK’.

Excel will, by default, give you a table with alternating blue colours. It will also make every column a filter. This is not accessible. 

#### Make the Excel default table accessible:
1. Click somewhere in the table 
2. Click the ‘Design’ ribbon.  
3. Select a plain table format in the ‘table styles’ section – scroll right to the top and you’ll see the plainest option with no formatting (you can make this the default table format Excel chooses). 
4. Uncheck the ‘Filter Button’ box in the 'Table Style Options' section. 
5. If you have row labels in the first column, the cell in the header row will automatically be labelled 'Column 1' - you need to replace this with something sensible. 

It is best practice to also:

* highlight column headings and row labels by setting the text to bold
* ensure the 'default' or 'automatic' colour is selected for all text (see the section on 'Colour and formatting' for more information on why this is important)
* left align all text in cells outside the table and all row labels within the table
* right align all data within a table and all column headings

##### Example of a table formatted in an accessible way
 <example to be added>

### Adding headers to a table that is already marked up

If the table is already created and you want to tag the header row:
1. Place the cursor anywhere in the table
2. Click onto the ‘Design’ ribbon 
3. Check the ‘Header Row’ box 

### Naming tables 

If you have a spreadsheet with lots of worksheets and many tables, you should make sure the tables have meaningful names. This will aid navigation for everyone, but particularly for those who use assistive technology. It will also help you pass [success criterion 2.4.6 headings and labels](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#headings-and-labels) and [guideline 2.4 navigable](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#navigable).

#### Name a table in Excel
1. Click anywhere in the table
2. Click the ‘Design’ ribbon 
3. In the properties section there is a box to edit the table name - to be useful this name must be meaningful and describe the table. 
4. Note that Excel doesn’t allow spaces or dashes in table names, words must be split up with underscores

#### Check navigation with named tables

If you want to see a list of all the tables in your worksheet go to the ‘Formulas’ ribbon and click ‘Name manager’. 
To test out navigation you can click ‘Ctrl + G’. This brings up a ‘Go to’ tool. You can then click onto one of your tables and select ‘OK’ to be taken directly to that table. 

### Column headings
Every table in your spreadsheet must have a correctly tagged header row, as described in the 'Mark up tables in spreadsheets' section. This is key to pass [success criterion 1.3.1 info and relationships](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#info-and-relationships). 

Bear in mind that Excel can only tag one row as the header row. It is not necessarily a fail if you have subheading rows but as they can't be tagged as headers it may make the table confusing - so whenever possible, it is best avoided. 

### Wrap text 

Use the ‘wrap text’ function and adjust row height and column width to ensure all text you want to appear in cells within a table is visible and clearly spaced out - this is important because users with dyslexia can find it difficult to read crowded text. It is also important because a screen reader will repeatedly read out ‘overflowing’ or ‘cropped’ after every cell which contains text that does not fit.

It is OK for text outside a table to overflow the cell – a screen reader will still read out ‘overflowing’ or ‘cropped’ but as this won’t be repetitive it is not a problem.

We consider this to be necessary to passs [guideline 1.4 distinguishable](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#distinguishable) but it is not specifically mentioned in the guidelines.

### Symbols and footnotes 

It is best practise to put as much information as possible at the point of need – for example when data is provisional or revised put the whole word in rounded brackets instead of using ‘p’ or ‘r’. When needed, using letters to signify notes is generally OK as long as the key to what these letters mean is clearly presented above the table in a cell in column A. This ensures a user is made aware of the key before coming to the table.

#### Example of presenting a key above a table 
 <insert example>

However, you should not use symbols to signify notes because: 
* they can be confusing
* screen readers may not recognise them 
* users with low vision may not be able to spot them easily

Therefore, if you use symbols to signify notes it may lead to a fail of [guideline 1. perceivable](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#perceivable) and [success criterion 1.3.1 info and relationships](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#info-and-relationships).

Similar arguments can also be made for the use of superscript. So we also advise against using this.  

When footnotes are needed, an accessible way to signify them is to use the word 'note'. If doing this, we advise you to:
* write out the word ‘note’ in the cell, with the number of the note, and put it in square brackets (we advise square brackets for notes and rounded brackets for units to differentiate them in a consistent way)
* put a list of numbers if a cell needs to refer to more than one note – for example, write ‘[note 1,2,3]’ if a cell needs to refer to notes 1, 2 and 3. 
* try to always put notes in table titles, column headings or row labels. Putting them in specific cells may not fail accessibility but it does cause problems for machine readability and usability 
* if a note is in a column heading, space the text so the note marker sits underneath the column header and any information about units (you can do this by pressing 'Alt + Enter')
#### Example of presenting units and note marker in column heading
 <insert example>
 
#### Other uses for symbols 

Symbols may be used in other ways. Be aware that some screen readers will skip over symbols completely. Consider how your text reads if you miss out the symbols, for example ‘Some shorthand is used in this spreadsheet, e = estimated, r = revised’ still makes sense if read out as ‘Some shorthand is used in this spreadsheet, e estimated, r revised’.  

Generally the percentage symbol ‘%’ is well understood by screen readers. 

Symbols like dashes and slashes can be used in classification and geography codes (more on this in the 'Classification and geography codes' section).  

We are looking to put together more comprehensive advice for symbols soon.  

#### Past advice on symbols and footnotes 
In terms of machine readability, the advice on symbols and notes has been to put symbols or footnote markers in separate (very narrow) columns, next to the data. It is OK to do this in terms of accessibility, but you would need to give that column a heading and mark up all the empty cells. This could make a table very wide which is not great for readability. 

#### Where to place detailed notes

It is common practice for notes to be placed underneath a table. However there are several issues with this. In terms of usability and accessibility: 
* for some users of assistive technology, it can take lots of scrolling to get to notes placed under very long tables 
* notes placed under tables may be missed by users of assistive technology who aren't expecting them to be there 
* notes placed underneath a table need careful (and mostly manual) formatting to be made accessible (see the section on 'Structure' for more information on how written content should be presented)

It is also the case that, in complex spreadsheets, identical notes are often placed under several tables across many worksheets. This can mean, when certain notes are updated or changed, some are accidentally missed out. 

Finally, notes placed underneath a table are bad practice for machine readability. 

For these reasons we advise you to create a worksheet called ‘Notes’ which contains a table that lists all the notes for the spreadsheet. 

In terms of accessibility, if you use notes it is best practice to mention this above your tables, in a cell in column A and say where the notes can be found. 

##### Example of talking about notes above a table
<insert example>

### Classification and geography codes 
In some instances you may need to use classification or geography codes in your tables. Make sure you are using the correct, nationally recognised codes. These codes are fine in terms of accessibility as they are normally strings of letters and numbers. 

When codes are not just strings of letters and numbers, you should still use codes consistently. It is OK to use symbols such as dashes and slashes here as that is how the code is constructed.

In terms of usability, machine readability and accessibility ([success criterion 1.3.1 info and relationships](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#info-and-relationships)), codes should be in separate cells to the description of the code and the data. For example, country code AD should be in a separate cell to the country name Andorra, and then another cell for the data linked to this. The row or column containing the codes must be labelled clearly. 

#### Example of setting out codes
<insert example>

### Blank cells

#### Accessibility and usability
When cells with no data are left blank it can cause confusion for users of assistive technology because it makes it difficult for them to work out where the table starts and ends. Therefore, blank cells could be considered a fail of [success criterion 1.3.1 info and relationships](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#info-and-relationships) and [guideline 2.4 navigable](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#navigable).

However, we are carrying out research into this, it may be the case that as long as a table is marked up correctly, blank cells within a table do not cause a problem for navigation with assistive technology. 

In terms of usability, blank cells do not tell a user why there is no data in the cell - a user might assume the data value is zero when this is not the case.

Therefore our current advice for cells with no data is to give users information about why there is no data, without using symbols like a minus sign (-) or full stops (..). Instead, blank cells should be marked up descriptively. 

Here are some examples of descriptions you may want to use: 
* If there is no data available, type in ‘no data’.
* If the data is missing, type in ‘missing’.
* If the data would be disclosive, type in 'disclosive'.

We advise against using 'NA' as while in statistics this often means Not Available, many users will assume it means Not Applicable. If you want to use NA as shorthand you must clearly define what it means, above the table, in a cell in column A so the information is available before a users comes to the table itself. 

The same advice stands if you want to expand on any of your descriptions of why a cell has no data. 

##### Example of expanding on a description of a cell with no data
<insert example>

Please note - we are aware that leaving cells with no data blank may make it easier for users to perform further analysis, but this feature of usability has to be balanced against the accessibility regulations and the user need to understand why a cell has no data. As mentioned, our advice on blank cells may change as we do further research. 

#### Machine readability 

In terms of machine readability leaving cells with no data blank is optimal. Therefore if you are making a spreadsheet solely for machine readability purposes it is best practice to leave cells with no data blank. 

### Adding alt text to tables 

You can add alternative text to your table by right clicking anywhere in the table and selecting ‘Table’ and ‘Alternative text’. However, it is not necessary to do this to pass the accessibility regulations - as long as you have marked your tables up correctly.  

Be aware that despite this, newer versions of Excel have a built-in accessibility checker which will bring up tables without alt text as a fail. You don’t need to worry about this. 

If you save your spreadsheet in the ODS open format (which we advise you to do) alternative text for tables will disappear – but this does not matter as it is not needed to pass the accessibility regulations. 

### Adding filters

We advise you to avoid adding filters. They may fail the accessibility regulations if they obscure data. 

If you do need to use filters it is important to provide signposts or comments to indicate which cells contain the drop-down menus and if any data is hidden. You should also give details of how to turn the filters off. For example: "Filters are active in cell C3 and may hide some data. To turn off all filters select the 'Data' ribbon then 'Filters' button or use [Ctrl, Shift, L]". This information should be in a cell in column A, above the table. 

### Adding freeze panes

We advise you to avoid adding freeze panes. They may fail the accessibility regulations as they can make it difficult for screen reader users to find the top left edge of a worksheet which is key to navigation. 

If you leave freeze panes active it is best practice to inform users and give a instructions for how to turn them off. For example: "Freeze panes are turned on. To turn off freeze panes select the 'View' ribbon then 'Freeze Panes' then 'Unfreeze Panes' or use [Alt W, F]". 
As with filters, this information should be in a cell in column A, above the table. 

Be aware that if you save your spreadsheet in the ODS open format (which we advise you to do) freeze panes will disappear. 

## Communicating uncertainty in spreadsheets

When designing a statistical spreadsheet, it is best practice to consider how to appropriately communicate any uncertainty to your users. Bear in mind that the user may not read detailed documents, or they may have copied the spreadsheet to use in another context.

Use notes or the cover sheet to: 
* make it clear if there are any potential sources of bias or uncertainty – users need to know how this impacts on their use of the statistics
* highlight relevant information about comparability issues both across time and with equivalent statistics released elsewhere in the UK 

For more information on notes and cover sheets please see the ‘Symbols and footnotes’ section and the ‘Metadata worksheets’ section.

### Confidence intervals 

When communicating confidence intervals it is best practice to put the higher and lower bounds in separate cells next to the data. Make sure all columns have clearly labelled column headings [success criterion 1.3.1 info and relationships](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#info-and-relationships). 

#### Example of how to present confidence intervals:
<insert example> 
 
### Statistical significance

Note that the credibility of assessing statistics using significance levels is currently under debate.

If you are communicating statistical significance it is best practrice to show where a change is statistically significant in a separate cell to the data, ideally using words, for example: ‘Significant at 0.001 level’.

If it is not possible to use words to describe the statistical significance, you can use shorthand. To make this accessible you must provide a key, above the table, in a cell in column A (see the section on 'Symbols and footnotes' for more information about presenting information in a key). 

In the past the asterisk symbol (*) has traditionally been used to communicate the level of statistical significance. Not all screen readers can understand the asterisk symbol and many users of assistive technology can find them difficult to see and understand. Using them is likely to fail [guideline 3.1 readable](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#readable). Therefore, if it is not possible to use words to describe the statistical significance you should use some form of shorthand using letters rather than the asterisk symbol. 


## Structure

Properly structuring your content is important in order to meet [success criterion 1.3.1 Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#info-and-relationships).

### Pointers for the spreadsheet as a whole

#### Provide supporting information 

From a usability point of view, statistics should not be completely separated from supporting information. Context and caveats are vital to ensure users have enough information to interpret and make effective use of the data. You should signpost to supporting information if it cannot be easily included within the spreadsheet tabs. 

#### Cover sheet and table of contents 

Label your first worksheet ‘Cover_sheet’ and use it to provide information about what is in the spreadsheet. If your spreadsheet has many worksheets, create a table of contents that describes the data within each worksheet.

More guidance on cover sheets and the table of contents can be found in the ‘Metadata worksheets’ section of this guidance.

#### Worksheet names

Ideally each worksheet should have a unique name that clearly describes the information found in that sheet. If this is not possible, give each sheet a number and use your table of contents to describe what is in each sheet number. 

To avoid any confusion for users of assistive technology remove extra spaces from the start or end of tab names. 
Keep worksheet tab names as consistent as you can between releases, as changing them limits usability. 

#### Blank worksheets

Remove any blank worksheets. Blank worksheets can be confusing as it is not clear if they are meant to be blank or if something is missing. They may also make navigation confusing for users of assistive technology. 

#### Other things to avoid 
* Do not use headers and footers to convey important information - this will fail accessibility as screen readers often can't find the information displayed in spreadsheet headers and footers.
* Do not use floating elements such as text boxes - these will fail accessibility as screen readers often can't 'see' inside text boxes
* Deactivate any floating toolbars - these may fail accessibility as screen reader software may not be able to access populated cells behind them - if you do need to leave a floating toolbar active then attach it to the other Excel toolbars at the top of the window.

### Pointers for structure within worksheets: 

#### Information that should go in cells in column A
Column A is very important for users of assistive technology. For example, a screen reader will generally start each tab by reading out the information in cell A1. Similarly, keyboard-only users will also tend to navigate down from cell A1. 

The key thing to ensure is the information a user needs to understand the table is positioned above the table, in a place where users of assistive technology are most likely to see it.    

Cell A1 on each worksheet should tell a user what information is contained on that worksheet. Generally, if there is one table per worksheet, cell A1 contains the title of that table. 

Cell A2 should be used for description – for example: ‘This worksheet contains one table. Some cells refer to notes which can be found on the notes worksheet tab’.  

If relevant, information about frozen panes, filters and any symbols or shorthand used within the table should also be added into a cell in column A. 

If you have several worksheet tabs and they use different sources, a cell in column A should contain information about the source(s) for the table on that sheet. However, if each table in the spreadsheet uses the same source(s), the information about source(s) can go on the cover sheet. 

#### Positioning tables on worksheets 
Position tables against the left-hand edges of each sheet. Don’t leave a blank column as a gap. As mentioned users of assistive technology tend to navigate down from cell A1, if they hit blank cells it can be very hard to navigate to where the table is. 

#### Below the table
Don’t put any information below the table. You should put all key information above the table and any detailed notes should live in a table on a ‘Notes’ worksheet tab (more information in the ‘Notes’ section of this guidance). 

#### Titles of spreadsheets, worksheets and tables
Make sure you have a clear spreadsheet title including time period and geographical region.
Use standard and consistent title formats.
The title of a table should include: 
* a description of the data,
* the geography it applies to 
* whether or not the data is seasonally adjusted
Example: ‘Number and percentage of people aged 16 to 64 in each labour market activity group, UK, seasonally adjusted’ 

It is best practice for a worksheet to only have one table. This means the title of the worksheet should be the title of the table. 

In large spreadsheets where worksheets are numbered instead of named you should include the table number in the title. For example: ‘Table 1: Number of people in different age groups, UK, seasonally adjusted’. 

#### Where to place and how to tag titles 
The worksheet title should always be in Cell A1 and should be marked up as Headings 1 using the ‘Cell Styles’ tool on the ‘Home’ ribbon. This helps users of assistive technology navigate around the spreadsheet. It is best to simplify the default colour and border settings for text tagged as a heading. Make the text bold, change the colour to black and remove all cell borders. 

## Metadata worksheets

### Cover sheet

If your data is simple and there is only one table in your spreadsheet, you might not need a cover sheet. However, they are generally useful in most circumstances.  

Use your cover sheet to provide key information about the data in the spreadsheet. But do not put too much information in it. If your cover sheet is starting to look more like a word document, you may need to create a webpage you can link to from the cover sheet instead.

Use subheadings to break up the information. These subheadings should be tagged using the cell styles tool. First level subheadings should be tagged as Headings 2, second level subheadings as Headings 3 and so on.  

Keep all the information in a list in column A and expand this column so the text doesn’t overflow the cells. 

Make sure all the written content follows the advice in the ‘Making written content accessible’ section of the ‘Making analytical publications accessible’ guidance.

Key things to include are: 
* Information on what the data tables in this spreadsheet are about (a brief description should be in Cell A1 with a more detailed description below if necessary)
* The statistical release the data relates to (if applicable) with a hyperlink to that release
* The source for the data - if you have a complex spreadsheet with many different tables and sources you can put source information on each individual worksheet (above the table) or have it as a column in your table of contents.  
* The date the spreadsheet was published 
* The date the next update to the spreadsheet will be published (if applicable)
* Where to find more information about the data (if applicable)
* Where to find related data or supporting publications(if applicable)
* Links to supporting metadata and methodology documents
* Link to a glossary of essential technical terms and acronyms.
* Contact details for the statisticians responsible for the data
* Key information users need to know that relates to all (or nearly all) worksheets in the spreadsheet, for example information on weighting

### Table of contents 

If you have many worksheets in your spreadsheet you should create a table of contents that describes the data within each worksheet. 

This can live within the cover sheet or on its own worksheet tab, but make sure it is marked up properly as a table and named ‘Table_of_contents’. If it is on its own tab make sure this is named ‘Table_of_contents’

This table of contents can also contain other information such as the source of the data (particularly if several different sources are used throughout the spreadsheet), the date the data in each worksheet was last updated and the date it will be next updated. 

Hyperlinking from the table of contents to cell A1 of each worksheet also aids navigation around a large spreadsheet.  

### Notes worksheet 

If certain cells in your spreadsheet refer to notes, it is better for accessibility and machine readability to create a table of notes on its own ‘Notes’ tab than put information underneath each table. 

Remember this table of notes needs to be marked up and named appropriately. 

## Worksheets with multiple tables 

When multiple tables do need to be placed on a single worksheet there are a few points to bear in mind.

### Worksheet titles 
Pointers: 
* The worksheet title should be in cell A1
* The worksheet title should describe the data in the tables, for example ‘Number and percentage of population in each labour market activity group by age band, UK, seasonally adjusted’
* The worksheet title should be marked up as a Headings 1 using the ‘Cell Styles’ tool on the ‘Home’ ribbon. 

Normally in large spreadsheets where worksheets are numbered instead of named, the title of each worksheet includes the table number, for example ‘Table 1: Number of people resident in each UK country’. When some worksheets have multiple tables, the worksheet titles cannot refer to specific tables. This means it is best to put the worksheet number in the title instead. For example: 
‘Worksheet 1: Number and percentage of population in each labour market activity group, UK, seasonally adjusted’
‘Worksheet 2: Number and percentage of population in each labour market activity group by age band, UK, seasonally adjusted’ 
etc. 

### Table titles
Each table within the worksheet should have a unique title, for example ‘Table 2a: Number and percentage of people aged 16 and over in each labour market activity group’. 
It is best to have a clear numbering or labelling structure. For example linking the table numbers to the worksheet number, so all the tables on worksheet 2 are table 2a, table 2b, table 2c and so on. 

Each table’s title should be in the leftmost cell directly above the table.

Each table title should be marked up as a ‘Headings 2’ using the ‘Cell Styles’ tool on the ‘Home’ ribbon.

### Structure 
* Cell A2 should describe the number of tables on the sheet and how they are presented, for example ‘This worksheet contains eight tables presented next to each other horizontally with one blank column in between each table. Each table applies to a different age group.’
* Each table should be marked up and named (more information on this in the tables section of this guidance) 
* The first table should border the left hand edge of the worksheet
* Tables should be separated by a single blank row or column - large gaps between tables could be misunderstood by screen reader users

## Accessibility checker
Newer versions of Excel have a built-in accessibility checker. You can use this to see what issues it flags up. But be aware that it is a bit like using a spelling and grammar check. It can’t check everything and it is likely to miss some things. 

The checker will also flag up tables that don’t have alt text (as already mentioned). You do not necessarily need to add this in and bear in mind that it will be removed if you save your spreadsheet in an ODT format. 

To run the accessibility checker, go to the ‘Review’ ribbon and select ‘Check Accessibility’.

## Saving and publishing spreadsheets
Pointers: 
* Generally a spreadsheet will automatically open on the first worksheet, but to ensure this always happens make sure the cursor is in cell A1 of the first worksheet when you save.
* Zoom should be set to 100% when you save your spreadsheet to ensure no enlargement or reduction is active.
* Avoid zip files as these can be blocked by organisational policies 
* Consider using an Application Programming Interface (API) to aid further analysis.

### File formats
Whenever possible you should publish your spreadsheet in an open format.

This is not explicitly mentioned in the accessibility regulations, but open formats make outputs more accessible because they do not rely on users having access to specific software.

Furthermore, in June 2012, the Government Open Data White Paper set out a vision for open data that outlined a ranking scheme from 1 to 5 stars. Government data releases should meet the 3 star measure as a minimum. This means make data available in an open, non-proprietary format.
Files published in Excel format (such as .xls and .xlsx) are not open because they rely on users having access to specific software.

#### ODS format
For spreadsheets you intend users to read and analyse we advise you use the Open Document Spreadsheet (ODS) format. This is an open format very similar to Excel. 
When you save as an ODS file, Excel will bring up a box to warn you that some features of your spreadsheet may not be compatible with the ODS format. If you want to know more, Microsoft have published information about Excel features that are and aren’t compatible with the ODS format.  

#### CSV format
The other commonly used open format is Comma-Separated-Values (CSV). 

If you are publishing a CSV file that you intend users to open and read, it must meet the accessibility regulations. This can be a bit tricky as it only allows one tab and will strip out almost all formatting (such as table tags, headings tags, hyperlinks and cell outlines). 

If you are publishing a CSV file solely for machines to read it does not need to meet the accessibility regulations. CSV is the recommended format for machine-readable spreadsheets. 

### Publishing alternative versions of same spreadsheet

If you need to, you can publish alternative versions of the same document. As long as one of them meets the accessibility regulations you are meeting the requirements of the accessibility legislation. 

For example, you may publish an accessible ODS version of your spreadsheet for users to open and read themselves, alongside a machine-readable CSV version. 

### Software capability 

You should be aware that different spreadsheet tools and software have different capabilities for how they handle data. Check the specifications of your software, particularly around row and column limits, to make sure you are using an appropriate tool. 

For example, older versions of Excel (97-2003) have a row limit of 65,000 rows. You can read more about Excel specifications and limits if you need to. 
If the spreadsheet tool you use cannot hold all your data then you are likely to lose information, which can distort statistics and conclusions.

### File names
File names should:
* be unique, e.g. don’t call all your data downloads ‘Data download’
* be descriptive and make sense out of context – for example, tell the user what is in a data download, don’t just call it ‘Data download 1’
* be frontloaded
* be short – aim for 60 characters including spaces
* not include acronyms – put these in the document information as keywords or tags
* be entirely in lowercase
* use dashes instead of spaces or underscores between words – this makes file names easier to read, for example: ‘a file name.ods’ will end up as: ‘a%20file%20name.ods’ online, which is why it is better to call it  ‘a-file-name.ods’
* not include a date, unless the date is part of the document title, for example, ‘Business-plan-for-2016-to-2017’
* be sensible – do not include a version number, names or words like ‘draft’, ‘clean’ or ‘final’, unless those words are part of the document title (for example: ‘guidance-on-how-to-make-documents accessible’ is a more sensible file name than ‘access-guid-final-draft-Han-edit3’)

There isn’t a specific success criterion in the accessibility guidelines for file names but it comes under ensuring content is understandable by making it readable and predictable [guidelines 3.1 and 3.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#readable).
